  <h1>Request to Remove SES Sandbox Restrictions</h1>
  <p>Dear AWS Support Team,</p>

  <p>My name is <strong>Leandro Lima</strong>, I’m 18 years old and currently a student in Portugal, pursuing studies in Science and Technology. I’m working on a personal, educational project where I reach out to technology companies across Europe to connect, learn from the industry, and gain real-world experience with programming and cloud tools like AWS.</p>

  <p>To make this possible, I kindly request the removal of sandbox restrictions from my SES account.</p>

  <p>Here’s how the project works: I’ve developed a system that gathers publicly available emails (such as <code>contact@</code>, <code>support@</code>, <code>marketing@</code>, etc.) from company websites. For each company, I send one email using <strong>BCC with up to 17 relevant addresses</strong>, always with a genuine, non-commercial intent.</p>

  <p>I want to emphasize that I fully understand and respect the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Each email is sent only once, and after delivery, <strong>all addresses are permanently deleted</strong> from my system. The emails are not used for marketing, stored, sold, or added to any mailing list. This is a one-time educational outreach effort.</p>

  <p>I would deeply appreciate your approval to move my SES account to production so I can continue this project on a wider scale.</p>

  <p>Please let me know if you require any additional information.</p>

  <p>Kind regards,</p>
  <p><strong>Leandro Lima</strong><br>
